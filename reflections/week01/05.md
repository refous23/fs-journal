# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

--- Not going to lie, this week was pretty challenging for me. It was frustrating at times but I pushed through it. With time, everything started to make more sense. I now feel a lot comfortable and I am truly excited to learn the rest. I really like the idea of using bootstrap.
